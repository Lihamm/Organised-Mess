# Organised-Mess

The purpose of this repository is to store and demonstrate the work I do as I start my professional career.

The work done is my own. However, some projects have been completed whilst learning and following a guide/tutorial.

Note about Project 4:

Project 4 is split into 2 sections, 1. Project 4 and 2. Project 4x. The first section uses the Coin Market Cap API to pull the data from the website whereas the other 
section of the project uses a downloaded sample of the API pull. This was done to prevent the pull cap from hitting the limit which occurred relatively quickly and prevented further access to the data.
